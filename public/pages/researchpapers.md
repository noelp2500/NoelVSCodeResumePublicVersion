## `Jan 19, 2023` [Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models in the Histopathologic Grading of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma](https://ijiset.com/vol10/v10s1/IJISET_V10_I1_14.pdf)

**Publication:** IJISET - International Journal of Innovative Science, Engineering & Technology

**Abstract:** One of the most common malignancies in the head and neck region is the Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). Its high mortality and morbidity coupled with a low survival rate make this cancer a pressing concern the world over [1]. TNM staging standards (8th edition, 2017) by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union against Cancer (UICC) and World Health Organization (WHO) histopathologic grading (4th edition, 2017) are a key step in management and treatment of OSCC. Machine learning has applications in varied domains of OSCC [2]. We present machine learning approaches including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost Classifier, Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees Classifier to analyze, correlate and subsequently, predict the histopathological grading of OSCC utilizing multiple data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database [3]. The results, post data wrangling were found to be 62.5%, 59.375%, 59.375%, 53.125% and 54.6875% respectively.

**Keywords:** Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, TNM staging, Histopathologic grading, Machine learning.

## `Nov 21, 2022` PDLW-Net: Novel Object Detection Variant of Vision Transformers in the Localization of Periodontal Ligament Widening

**Publication:** Due to be published in Springer book series ‚ÄôAlgorithms for Intelligent Systems‚Äô

**Conference:** Springer - 4th International Conference on Sustainable and Innovative Solutions for Current Challenges in Engineering & Technology (ICSISCET 2022)

**Abstract:** The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a fibrous connective tissue helping anchor the tooth in its position in the jaw. It is a key player in managing occlusal loads and tissue turnover due to its heterogeneous fibers interspersed with cells [1]. However, due to multifactorial causes there can sometimes present an exclusive radiographic finding of a widened periodontal ligament space (PDLW). This widening, if left undiagnosed and untreated, has potential to cause a multitude of events, and in extreme cases even loss of affected dentition. In the domain of periodontology numerous types of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [3] and Transformer models have been applied. We thereby introduce Novel PDLW-Net, a state-of-the-art PDL Widening Detection and Localization System, which is an object detection variant of Vision Transformers with a Multi-Layer Attention Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron trained on a custom labelled and validated dataset with radiographs obtained from the Tufts Dental Database [2]. The Mean Square Error of the Validation and Training set was found to be 0.0438 and 0.0998 respectively and the average IoU (Intersection over Union) of the tested images was found to be 0.63.

**Keywords:** PDLW-Net, PDLW, Vision Transformers.

## `Aug 18, 2022` [Classification Of Heart Sounds with RF Feature Extraction and CNN Modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9848949)

**Publication:** IEEE Xplore

**Conferences:** 2022 IEEE World Conference on Applied Intelligence and Computing (AIC) and 6th International Student Research Colloquium on Advances in Engineering & Information Technology (AEIT-2021)

**Abstract:** Heart attacks and strokes are leading causes of death globally. The NCD Alliance estimates that by 2030, almost 23.3 million people will die from cardiovascular disease every year [1]. With a tally of such high rates, the need for methods for identification and prevention of heart attacks and strokes was eminent. By today‚Äôs standards, ECG majorly, along with other imaging techniques play a key role in detecting heart conditions and abnormalities. The disadvantage of ECG stems from the fact that it requires highly specialized equipment to get a reading. In this paper we attempt to replace the current standard with phonocardiography, which involves the reading of heart sounds with the help of a stethoscope. We then attempt to select the best classification techniques among Random Forest algorithm, Logistic Regression, Adaboost and Support Vector Machine for feature extraction and then build the CNN model. This paper also discusses the accuracy of the different models with inhouse experimentation. The feature extraction accuracy of Random Forest algorithm, Logistic Regression, Adaboost and Support Vector Machine were found to be 76.923077%, 63.247863%, 64.957265% and 64.102564% respectively. The training and testing accuracy of the CNN model were found to be 74.76% and 76.92% respectively.

**Keywords:** Heart Sound, CNN Modeling, Random Forest.

## `Apr 25, 2022` [PereiraASLNet: ASL letter recognition with YOLOX taking Mean Average Precision and Inference Time considerations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9760665)

**Publication:** IEEE Xplore

**Conference:** 2022 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP)

**Abstract:** Sign language essentially allows for communication without the need to explicitly say words. It was developed by the American School for the Deaf in the early 90‚Äôs. It is a naturally generated language which incorporates facial movements and hand gestures to convey thoughts and ideas. In modern times, it is used predominantly by people who are deaf and hard of hearing. Unlike most languages, ASL isn‚Äôt widely taught which makes it difficult for the general population to communicate effectively with those people who predominantly use ASL as the sole means of communication. Therefore, arises the need for a system which detects and predicts letters from images and which can then be used in real time to overcome this language barrier. This research aims to develop a sign language recognition system atop of YOLOX, which is built on top of YOLOV3, which contains in its architecture, convolutional neural networks. Using the various backbones of YOLOX, this paper introduces and provides six models on every end of the accuracy-testing time spectrum from least accurate/fastest response time to the most accurate/slowest response time. I thereby propose PereiraASLNet, which trains YOLOX with custom classes from the letters A-Z and a Pascal VOC XML American Sign Language dataset developed by Roboflow and variants of YOLOX have been developed, taking into consideration the mean average precision and inference times of all the YOLOX backbone architectures namely the YOLOX-nano, YOLOX-tiny, YOLOX-small, YOLOX-medium, YOLOX-large and YOLOX-xlarge. The testing mean average precision for the models were found to be ‚Äì 0.9046, 0.9070, 0.9227, 0.9304, 0.9329 and 0.9578 and the testing inference time was found to be 3.50ms, 12.97ms, 34.86ms, 64.56ms, 83.23ms and 97.56ms respectively

## `Aug 13, 2021` [Novel Technology to Revolutionize the Process of Jury Selection and Voir Dire in Criminal Cases](https://www.ijlsi.com/paper/novel-technology-to-revolutionize-the-process-of-jury-selection-and-voir-dire-in-criminal-cases/)

**Publication:** International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation

**Abstract:** This paper conceptualizes the shortcomings of the manual jury selection process; a feature we perceive as a legal deficit with detrimental consequences to the judicial systems across nations. It introduces a pioneering operationalization: The PereiraJuryNet. We contribute by outlining the jury selection processes and a subsequent assessment of the problems associated with the manual selection of jurors by the prosecution and defense. Mindful of the inefficiencies of the manual jury selection system we advocate the use of machine learning algorithms in jury selection devoid of human bias and prejudice. We developed the PereiraJuryNet using Random Forest, SVM, Adaboost and Naive-Bayes machine learning models. Our proposed model recognizes key traits commonly considered during jury selection and voir dire such as political preference and awareness, conflicts of interest, demographic traits, experience and knowledge etc. and cross- references these with the nature and facts of diverse cases thereby being able to generate the 12 jurors best suited for any given case. Further, we illustrate the need, mechanics, data science and machine learning pipeline of the PereiraJuryNet model and provide suggestions for future work.
