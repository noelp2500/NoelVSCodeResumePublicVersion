## [Classification of Heart Sounds](https://github.com/noelp2500/Classification-Of-Heart-Sounds-Project) ðŸ”—

- The data was gathered from two sources:
  - (A) from the public via the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app
  - (B) from a clinic trial in hospitals using the digital stethoscope DigiScope.
- This work is proposed to implement this classification task in two methods:
  - (A) Feature extraction with various ML algorithms.
  - (B) Classification using CNN
- Performed audio data analysis to obtain spectogram images of heart sounds using librosa and matplotlib libraries
- Created a dataset by extracting features of the spectogram - MFCC, RMSE, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Bandwidth, Spectral Roll-off, Zero Crossing Rate and Chroma Frequencies
- Feature Selection with LR,RF,Adaboost and SVM with accuracy of 0.6324, 0.7692, 0.6495 and 0.6410
- Built a CNN model with training accuracy of 0.7476 and testing accuracy of 0.7436
- _**Tools -**_ Python, Numpy, OpenCV2, SciPy.
