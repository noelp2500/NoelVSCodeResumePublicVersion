## EventsDiva (E-Diva) `Work by Divija Naredla, Noel Pereira, Silas Everett, Luis Wenus`

E-Diva (EventDiva), your next productivity daily, is an event generation app which automatically generates events from your emails (across all major email clients), regardless of whether it comes in as a structured event card (like Luma) or unstructured (like an impromptu event invite like "Hey Noel, We should meet at the Harbor at 7pm"). All these AI generated events can be viewed on our minimalist UI or can be viewed on any calendar agent of your choice (like google calendar).

It goes beyond a normal event generator by accessing the entire power of AI to not just get you the intricate details of the event (like date and time), but also populates external information not directly made available. Examples of it, but not limited to this, are:

- If the party is a casual BYOB (Bring your own bottle), it will create a checklist of items which include "Bring a bottle" and "Casual event, so be sure to wear something semi formal!"
- It can be used to show you real-time weather, traffic and time-difference information through a google map intregration or via other api services
- It can alert you if the event is hosted in places which aren't safe, and will automatically send this event information to other users who the user allows, as a safety feature
- You can create and generate events and share it with friends on the app, which syncs everyone's E-Diva and tacks it onto their calendar
- It can have a bulletin for each event, which can be accessed by all who have an invite, where questions can be asked and addressed.

Ofcourse, the idea itself is not fully fleshed out, but is available for further ideation.

## LeadingYouToA100 `Work by Noel Pereira, Divija Naredla, Sanjeeb Dey`

LeadingYouToA100, as the name shows, is your tool to "Lead you to a 100 years". Instead of traditional health apps which besieges you with a bundle of charts giving you the metrics without any further information, we decided to rethink this by creating your experience in the form of a chatbot which when asked questions like "What's my heart rate like, for the past 14 days" will give you a chart with your heart rate for 14 days, but also provides you AI based insights on how to improve upon it (if necessary). 

The key features include - 
- Sync data from healthwatches (Apple Watch) and manually through the upload of PDFs
- Chatbot like UI generating and presenting data based on user query
- AI based insights on how to improve on metric
- Provides further insights by providing exercises and diet suggestions
- State of the art recipe generator based on the ingredients in your fridge while keeping in mind the health information provided by you

- _**Tools Used Currently -**_ React Native, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python, Flask, Supabase, Palm API .

- Idea accepted and demo presented at Microsoft Reactor TedAI Hackathon hosted on October 14th and October 15th, 2023 in San Francisco.
